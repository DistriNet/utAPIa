This repository cntains our proof-of-concept implementation for our paper **A User-centric Approach to API Delegation: Enforcing Privacy Policies on OAuth Delegations**.




* `/browser-extension`: A Chrome extension browser extension that add Rich Authorization Request (RAR) parameters to the ongoing authorization reqeust to our API. 
* `/resource-server`: The baseline API which is protected by utAPI to enforce privacy policies on API response. For our OAuth implemetation we used [Authlete](https://www.authlete.com/) and deployed [`java-oauth-server`](https://github.com/authlete/java-oauth-server) as our authorization server.
